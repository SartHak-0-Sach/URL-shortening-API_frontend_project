## Overview

### The challenge

Shortly is a URL shortening app that allows users to shorten any valid URL, see a list of their shortened links (even after refreshing the browser), copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click, and receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty. Users can view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/URL-shortening-API_frontend_project.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.
